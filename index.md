# Privacy Policy for NextinAI
**Last updated:** August 19, 2025

## Who we are
NextinAI (“we”, “our”, “us”) provides AI-related news and discussions.

## Information we collect
- We do not require accounts and do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information from app usage.  
- If you email us, we receive your email address and message so we can reply.  
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** is used for optional push notifications; the service uses a device token to deliver messages.  
- **On-device storage:** bookmarks, muted keywords, and settings are stored **locally on your device** and are **not uploaded** to our servers.

## How we use information
- Device tokens are used only to deliver notifications you opt into.  
- Support emails are used only to respond to you.

## Third-party services
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (Google)** delivers notifications and may process device/usage information required to operate the service.  
- When you open articles or Reddit posts, you visit third-party sites that have their own privacy practices.

## Sharing and selling
We do **not** sell your personal data. We share data only with service providers operating on our behalf (e.g., Firebase) for the purposes above.

## Retention & your choices
- Notification tokens stay active while notifications are enabled; disable notifications in device settings or uninstall the app to stop receiving them.  
- Support emails are kept as long as needed to address your request; you may ask us to delete them.  
- Local bookmarks/settings remain on your device until you clear app data or uninstall.

## Children’s privacy
The app isn’t directed to children under 13.

## Changes to this policy
We may update this policy; the “Last updated” date will change when we do.
